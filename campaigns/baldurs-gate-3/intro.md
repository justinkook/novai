# Baldur's Gate 3 - The Adventure Begins

You awaken aboard a nautiloid ship, your head pounding with a strange, alien presence. A Mind Flayer tadpole has been implanted in your brain, and you're hurtling through the Astral Plane. The ship is under attack by Githyanki warriors, and you must fight for your survival while coming to terms with your new... condition.

As you struggle to escape the crashing vessel, you'll encounter other survivors - potential companions who share your fate. Together, you'll embark on a journey across the Forgotten Realms, seeking a cure for the tadpole while uncovering ancient secrets and facing impossible choices.
