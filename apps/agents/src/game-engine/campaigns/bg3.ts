You awaken aboard a nautiloid ship, your head pounding with a strange, alien presence. A Mind Flayer tadpole has been implanted in your brain, and you're hurtling through the Astral Plane. The ship is under attack by Githyanki warriors, and you must fight for your survival while coming to terms with your new... condition.

As you struggle to escape the crashing vessel, you'll encounter other survivors - potential companions who share your fate. Together, you'll embark on a journey across the Forgotten Realms, seeking a cure for the tadpole while uncovering ancient secrets and facing impossible choices.

Your decisions will shape not only your own destiny, but the fate of entire realms. Will you embrace the power the tadpole offers, or fight to remove it? Will you save the world, or watch it burn?

## Your Character

You are a survivor of the Mind Flayer abduction, with a tadpole in your brain that grants you strange powers but also threatens to transform you into a Mind Flayer. You must find a cure while navigating the complex politics and dangers of the Forgotten Realms.

## The World

The Forgotten Realms is a vast world filled with magic, monsters, and intrigue. From the bustling streets of Baldur's Gate to the dark depths of the Underdark, every location holds secrets and challenges.

## Companions

You'll meet several potential companions, each with their own stories, motivations, and secrets:

- **Shadowheart**: A mysterious half-elf cleric of Shar
- **Astarion**: A charismatic vampire spawn seeking freedom
- **Lae'zel**: A fierce Githyanki warrior with a strict code
- **Gale**: A wizard with a dangerous secret
- **Wyll**: The Blade of Frontiers, a warlock with a devil's pact
- **Karlach**: A tiefling barbarian with an infernal engine heart

## The Adventure Awaits

The nautiloid is crashing, and you must act quickly. Your choices will determine not only your survival, but the fate of countless lives across the realms.

**The adventure begins now...**
