# Quick Start

Get your first AI-powered tabletop RPG campaign running in minutes with NovAI. This guide will walk you through setting up the development environment, creating your first campaign, and running a game session.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **Git**

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/novai.git
cd novai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Database Configuration (if using)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

# Authentication (if using)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Code Quality Tools

NovAI uses **Biome** for linting and formatting. The project is pre-configured with Biome, so you can start coding immediately:

```bash
# Format all code
pnpm format

# Check for linting issues
pnpm lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
pnpm lint:fix
```

## Running the Development Environment

### 1. Start the API Server

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

This starts the NestJS API server on `http://localhost:3001`.

### 2. Start the Web Application

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

This starts the Next.js web application on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Start the Documentation

```bash
pnpm dev:docs
```

This starts the documentation site on `http://localhost:3002`.

## Creating Your First Campaign

### 1. Campaign Structure

Create a new campaign directory in the `campaigns/` folder:

```bash
mkdir campaigns/my-first-campaign
cd campaigns/my-first-campaign
```

### 2. Campaign Configuration

Create `campaign.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my-first-campaign",
  "name": "My First Adventure",
  "description": "A beginner-friendly fantasy adventure",
  "ruleset": "dnd-5e",
  "intro": "Welcome to the world of My First Adventure..."
}
```

### 3. Campaign Introduction

Create `intro.md`:

```markdown
# Welcome to My First Adventure

You find yourself standing at the gates of the small village of Oakdale. 
The morning sun casts long shadows across the cobblestone streets, and 
the sound of blacksmiths working fills the air.

A young villager approaches you with a concerned expression.

"Adventurer!" they call out. "We need your help. Strange noises have 
been coming from the old mill at night, and some of our livestock has 
gone missing. Can you investigate?"

What would you like to do?
```

### 4. Campaign Companions

Create `companions.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "elder",
    "name": "Elder Oak",
    "description": "A wise village elder with knowledge of local history",
    "stats": {
      "intelligence": 16,
      "wisdom": 14,
      "charisma": 12
    },
    "personality": "Wise and patient, but sometimes forgetful",
    "background": "Has lived in Oakdale for over 50 years"
  }
]
```

### 5. Campaign Locations

Create `locations.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "village_gates",
    "name": "Oakdale Village Gates",
    "description": "The main entrance to the village of Oakdale",
    "connections": ["village_square", "old_mill", "forest_path"],
    "features": ["guard_tower", "notice_board", "merchant_stalls"],
    "atmosphere": "Busy and welcoming, with travelers coming and going"
  },
  {
    "id": "village_square",
    "name": "Oakdale Village Square",
    "description": "The heart of the village with a central fountain",
    "connections": ["village_gates", "tavern", "shop", "elder_home"],
    "features": ["fountain", "market_stalls", "town_hall"],
    "atmosphere": "Lively and colorful, filled with villagers going about their day"
  }
]
```

## Running Your First Game

### 1. Using the Game Engine

Create a simple script to test your campaign:

```typescript
// test-game.ts
import { GameEngineService } from '@novai/engine';

const llmConfig = {
  provider: 'openai',
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  model: 'gpt-4'
};

const engine = new GameEngineService(llmConfig);

async function runGame() {
  // Create a new game
  const gameState = await engine.createNewGame('my-first-campaign', 'Adventurer');
  
  console.log('Game started!');
  console.log('Campaign:', gameState.campaignId);
  console.log('Player:', gameState.playerName);
  
  // Process player input
  const response = await engine.processGameRequest({
    gameState,
    playerInput: 'I want to investigate the old mill',
    context: { timeOfDay: 'morning' }
  });
  
  console.log('\nGame Master Response:');
  console.log(response.narration);
  
  if (response.choices) {
    console.log('\nAvailable choices:');
    response.choices.forEach((choice, index) => {
      console.log(`${index + 1}. ${choice}`);
    });
  }
  
  if (response.statCheck) {
    console.log('\nStat Check:');
    console.log(`${response.statCheck.stat} check (DC ${response.statCheck.difficulty})`);
    console.log(`Roll: ${response.statCheck.result} (${response.statCheck.success ? 'Success' : 'Failure'})`);
  }
}

runGame().catch(console.error);
```

### 2. Running the Test

```bash
npx tsx test-game.ts
```

## Using the Web Interface

## Using the API

### 1. Authentication

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "campaignId": "my-first-campaign",
    "playerName": "Adventurer"
  }'
```

### 3. Process Player Input

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/game/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "gameId": "GAME_ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_RESPONSE",
    "playerInput": "I want to explore the village square",
    "context": {
      "timeOfDay": "morning"
    }
  }'
```

## Customizing Your Campaign

### 1. Adding Custom Rulesets

Create a custom ruleset in `packages/rulesets/src/`:

```typescript
// packages/rulesets/src/custom-fantasy.ts
import { Ruleset, RulesetConfig } from '@novai/rulesets';

const customConfig: RulesetConfig = {
  name: 'custom-fantasy',
  description: 'A custom fantasy RPG ruleset',
  version: '1.0.0',
  stats: ['strength', 'agility', 'intelligence', 'charisma'],
  skills: {
    strength: ['athletics', 'intimidation'],
    agility: ['acrobatics', 'stealth'],
    intelligence: ['arcana', 'history'],
    charisma: ['deception', 'persuasion']
  },
  combatRules: {
    initiative: { type: 'd20', modifier: 'agility' },
    actions: [
      {
        name: 'attack',
        type: 'attack',
        range: 5,
        damage: { die: 6, count: 1, modifier: 'strength' }
      }
    ],
    damage: { type: 'hp', deathThreshold: 0 },
    conditions: []
  },
  statCheckRules: {
    baseDie: 20,
    modifierCalculation: (stat) => Math.floor((stat - 10) / 2),
    criticalSuccess: 20,
    criticalFailure: 1
  }
};

export const CustomFantasyRuleset = new Ruleset(customConfig);
```

### 2. Creating Custom Prompts

Create custom prompt templates in `packages/prompts/src/`:

```typescript
// packages/prompts/src/custom-adventure.ts
import { PromptTemplate } from '@novai/prompts';

export const CustomAdventurePrompt = new PromptTemplate({
  name: 'custom-adventure',
  systemTemplate: `You are a master storyteller running a {genre} adventure.

CAMPAIGN: {campaign}
STYLE: {style}
TONE: {tone}

RULES:
- Use {perspective} narration
- Provide {choiceCount} meaningful choices
- Include {mechanics} when relevant
- Maintain {consistency} throughout the story`,
  userTemplate: `PLAYER: {playerName}
LOCATION: {location}
INVENTORY: {inventory}
COMPANIONS: {companions}

INPUT: {input}

Respond as the Game Master, continuing the narrative.`,
  variables: ['genre', 'style', 'tone', 'perspective', 'choiceCount', 'mechanics', 'consistency']
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. OpenAI API Key Issues

**Problem**: "Invalid API key" errors

**Solution**: 
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account
- Check that the API key has the necessary permissions

#### 2. Campaign Loading Errors

**Problem**: Campaign not found or invalid

**Solution**:
- Verify campaign files are in the correct directory structure
- Check JSON syntax in campaign configuration files
- Ensure all required files (`campaign.json`, `intro.md`) exist

#### 3. Development Server Issues
