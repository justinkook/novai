# Data Sources for AI Agent

Data sources are the foundation of your AI agent's knowledge and context. They provide the information your AI needs to create rich, engaging RPG experiences.

## Overview

The NovAI data sources system allows you to:

- **Import documents** and knowledge bases
- **Process and index** content for AI consumption
- **Provide context** to your AI agent during gameplay
- **Manage multiple sources** for different campaigns or settings

## Types of Data Sources

### 1. Campaign Documentation

Store campaign-specific information:

```markdown
# Baldur's Gate 3 Campaign

## Setting
The city of Baldur's Gate and surrounding areas...

## Characters
- Astarion: A vampire spawn seeking freedom
- Shadowheart: A cleric of Shar with mysterious past
- Gale: A wizard with a magical condition

## Rules and Mechanics
- Combat uses D&D 5e rules
- Magic is prevalent but regulated
- Political intrigue is common
```

### 2. Game Rules and Mechanics

Document your game's rules system:

```markdown
# D&D 5e Rules Reference

## Ability Scores
- Strength: Physical power and athletic training
- Dexterity: Agility, reflexes, and balance
- Constitution: Health, stamina, and force of will
- Intelligence: Mental acuity and reasoning
- Wisdom: Awareness and intuition
- Charisma: Force of personality

## Combat
- Initiative determines turn order
- Actions include Attack, Cast Spell, Dash, etc.
- Movement is limited by speed
```

### 3. World Lore and Background

Rich world-building information:

```markdown
# Forgotten Realms Lore

## Geography
The Sword Coast stretches along the western edge of Faerûn...

## History
The Time of Troubles reshaped the world...

## Organizations
- The Harpers: Secret organization for good
- The Zhentarim: Mercenary company with dark goals
- The Lords' Alliance: Coalition of city-states
```

## Setting Up Data Sources

### 1. Create Documentation Files

Place your documentation in the `campaigns/` directory:

```
campaigns/
├── baldurs-gate-3/
│   ├── campaign.json
│   ├── intro.md
│   ├── characters.md
│   ├── rules.md
│   └── lore.md
└── your-campaign/
    ├── campaign.json
    └── documentation.md
```

### 2. Configure Campaign Data

Each campaign should have a `campaign.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "Baldur's Gate 3",
  "description": "An epic adventure in the Forgotten Realms",
  "ruleset": "dnd-5e",
  "dataSources": [
    "campaigns/baldurs-gate-3/intro.md",
    "campaigns/baldurs-gate-3/characters.md",
    "campaigns/baldurs-gate-3/rules.md",
    "campaigns/baldurs-gate-3/lore.md"
  ],
  "aiAgent": {
    "personality": "experienced DM with deep knowledge of D&D",
    "style": "immersive and descriptive",
    "difficulty": "moderate"
  }
}
```

### 3. Process Data Sources

The AI agent will automatically process and index your documentation:

```typescript
// The engine loads data sources when starting a campaign
const campaign = await loadCampaign('baldurs-gate-3');
const dataSources = await processDataSources(campaign.dataSources);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Structure Your Content

- Use clear headings and sections
- Include examples and code blocks
- Keep related information together
- Use consistent formatting

### 2. Provide Context

- Include character motivations and backgrounds
- Document important locations and NPCs
- Explain game mechanics clearly
- Add flavor text and descriptions

### 3. Update Regularly

- Keep documentation current with game changes
- Add new information as the campaign evolves
- Remove outdated or incorrect information
- Version control your documentation

## Advanced Features

### Vector Search

The AI agent uses vector search to find relevant information:

```typescript
// When the AI needs context, it searches the knowledge base
const relevantInfo = await searchKnowledgeBase(query, dataSources);
```

### Context Injection

Relevant information is automatically injected into AI prompts:

```typescript
// The AI receives context about the current situation
const prompt = `
Context: ${relevantInfo}

Current situation: ${gameState.description}

Player action: ${playerAction}

Response as the game master:
`;
```

### Multi-Source Support

You can combine multiple data sources:

```json
{
  "dataSources": [
    "campaigns/baldurs-gate-3/core.md",
    "rulesets/dnd-5e/rules.md",
    "worlds/forgotten-realms/lore.md"
  ]
}
```

## Integration with AI Agent

The data sources system integrates seamlessly with your AI agent:

1. **Automatic Loading**: Data sources are loaded when starting a campaign
2. **Context Injection**: Relevant information is provided to the AI
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Changes to documentation are reflected in gameplay
4. **Search Integration**: The AI can search for specific information

## Example: Baldur's Gate 3 Campaign

Here's how the Baldur's Gate 3 campaign uses data sources:

```markdown
# Campaign Overview

The party begins in the Nautiloid, a mind flayer ship...

## Key Characters
