# Getting Started with NovAI

Welcome to NovAI, an AI-powered text RPG engine that combines the best of traditional role-playing games with modern AI capabilities. This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is NovAI?

NovAI is a comprehensive platform for creating AI-powered text RPGs. It consists of several key components:

- **Game Engine**: A robust engine for managing game state, actions, and rules
- **AI Agent**: An intelligent agent that can act as a game master
- **Data Sources**: A knowledge base system for providing context to the AI
- **Web Interface**: A modern web app for playing and managing games

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 20 or higher)
- **pnpm** (for package management)
- **Git** (for version control)

## Quick Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd novai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

This will start:
- **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Server**: http://localhost:3001
- **Documentation**: http://localhost:3002
